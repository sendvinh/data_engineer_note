## 1. Introduction to Data Engineering

**Data Engineering** convert raw data into usable data  
Extract, integrate, and organize data from disparate sources  
Clean, transform, and prepare data  
Design, store, and manage data in data repositories  
Skills:  
Good knowledge of programming  
Sound knowledge of systems and technology architectures  
In-depth understanding of relational databases and non-relational datastores  
    
**Data Analytics** use this data to generate insights  
Inspect and clean data for deriving insights  
Identify correlations, find patterns, and apply statistical methods to analyze and mine data  
Visualize data to interpret and present the findings of data analysis  
Ex: Are the users search experiences generally good or bad with the search functionality on our site?  
What is the popular perception of peple regarding our rebranding initiatives?  
Is there a co-relation between sales of one product and another?  
Skills:  
Good knoledge of spreadsheets, wrting queries, use statistical tools to create charts and dashboards  
Programming skills  
Strong analytical and story-telling skills  

**Data Scientist** use DA and DE to predict the future suing data from the past  
Create predictive models using Machine Learning and Deep Learning  
Ex: (related to predition)  
How many new social media followers am I likely to get nex month?  
What percentage of my customers am I like ly to lose to competition in next quarter?  
Skills:  
Mathematics and Statistics  
Programming languages, databaases, building datamodels  
Domain knowledge  

**Business Analyst and BI analyst** leverage the work of DA and DS to look at possible implications for their business and **actions** they need to take or recommend.

##### Field of data engineering involves:  
**Collecting source data**: extrating, integrating, oragnizing data from disparate sources  
(develop tool, workflow, process to acquire data from multiple sources;  
design, build, maintain scalable data architecture to store data)  
**Processing data**: cleaning transforming, preparing data to make it usable   (implement, maintain distributed systems for large scale processing of data;  
design pipelines for ETL of data into data repositories;  
design/implement solution for validating and safeguarding quality, privacy and security of data;  
optimize tools, systems, and workflows for performances, reliability and scalablity;  
ensure data meets all regulatory and compliance guidelines)
